Subject: Attempt to Resolve Dispute

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to you in relation to a disagreement I have with your company.

Here are the details: [Clearly explain your issue. If you have a contract or have placed an order, specify all the elements that will help the company identify you (contract number and date, member ID, order number and date, etc.)]

Consequently, I kindly request that [state here what the company needs to do to resolve your dispute. For example, pay the outstanding amount, redo work, replace a defective product, complete a service, provide justification. You can also set a reasonable deadline for this action.]

I would like to inform you that I have also filed a report on the website https://signal.conso.gouv.fr operated by the Directorate General for Consumer Affairs, Competition, and Fraud Prevention. I have attached a copy of my report to this letter. You have the option to respond to me either through SignalConso or by contacting me directly.

Should you persist in ignoring my request or if your response is unsatisfactory, I will be compelled to engage a mediator or conciliator, and I reserve all options for legal action to assert my rights.

Awaiting your response, I remain sincerely,

[Name + Signature]
