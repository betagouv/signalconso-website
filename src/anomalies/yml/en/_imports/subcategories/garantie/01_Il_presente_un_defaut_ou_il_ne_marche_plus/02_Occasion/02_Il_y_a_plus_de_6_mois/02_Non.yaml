        Do you want to sue the company for "hidden defects"?
        <br/><br/>A latent defect in a product is a defect: <ul> <li>which renders
        the unusable product, </li> <li>present from the start and</li> <li>that
        you did not know when you purchased the product.</li> </ul>
      answer: >-
        It is up to you to prove the existence of the hidden defect, with a report
        of expertise, for example. <br/>You are two years from the
        discovery of the defect to make the request.
